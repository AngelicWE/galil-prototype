# GalilMotion HCD Configuration - DEFAULT
# Based on SDD Section 4.4, Figure 4-3

# This is the default configuration file loaded by the HCD.
# Currently configured for SIMULATOR mode for safe testing.

# QUICK SWITCH GUIDE:
#   Simulator: cp GalilHcdConfig-Simulator.conf GalilHcdConfig.conf
#   Hardware:  cp GalilHcdConfig-Hardware.conf GalilHcdConfig.conf
#
# Or manually edit the controller settings below.
